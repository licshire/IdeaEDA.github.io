      <description> LibrePCB is a free EDA software to develop printed circuit boards. It&amp;rsquo;s currently under heavy development to bring out first stable releases as soon as possible.
Key Features:  Cross-platform (Unix/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows) All-in-one (project management, library/schematic/board editors) Intuitive, modern and easy-to-use graphical user interface Very powerful library design with some innovative concepts Human-readable file formats Open Source (GNU GPLv3)  Interested? Try it out! </description>

      <description>The control panel gives you fast access to all of your projects, especially to recently used and favorite projects. It also shows you the description of projects without opening them, if available. Just create a README.md inside your project&amp;rsquo;s directory!</description>

      <title>Schematic Editor</title>

      <description>The schematic editor is very easy to use and still powerful. Thanks to the innovative library concept, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about choosing footprints while drawing the schematic. In contrast to other EDA tools, you also don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about manually assigning symbol pins to footprint pads later in the board editor.</description>

      <description>Ever struggled in the middle of layouting if you need to relocate some devices before continue routing the traces? LibrePCB&amp;rsquo;s board editor just lets you fork your half-done layout to continue with two different layouting strategies! Of course all of the existing boards are always in sync with the schematics.</description>

      <description>When adding components to the schematic, most EDA tools let you choose them from a simple list of the installed libraries (often named by manufacturer). LibrePCB thinks this is a stupid system and thus lets you choose your components from a tree of categories instead, no matter which library provides them.</description>

      <description>Managing libraries has never been easier than with LibrePCB&amp;rsquo;s library manager. It downloads, installs and updates libraries directly from the internet. No more need to do this manually.</description>

      <description>The Free and Open Source Software Developers&amp;rsquo; European Meeting (FOSDEM) is a great event for developers and users interested in free software. It is hosted at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium. This year it takes place on February 3 / 4.

There are many different tracks available, but for us the most interesting one is the CAD and Open Hardware devroom. It contains talks about PCB design, FPGA design, SPICE simulation and open hardware in general.</description>

      <title>LibrePCB Has Switched to S-Expressions</title>

      <description>One major goal of LibrePCB is to use human readable files to represent libraries, projects and so on. This is important to let the user understand what the EDA tool actually does when modifying a schematic or board. In addition, a good file format is essential for version control systems to keep track of changes in libraries and projects.
But LibrePCB doesn&amp;rsquo;t just want to have some human readable file format.</description>

      <description>Here it is: The long awaited blog of LibrePCB!
It&amp;rsquo;s still very basic, but this will be improved some time ;)
From now on, we will use this blog to provide various information, e.g. announcements of upcoming events, release notes, development progress or technical explanations.
If you have any input regarding this blog or our website in general, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.</description>
